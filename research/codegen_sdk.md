# Codegen SDK for Codebase Analysis

This document identifies features and functionality from the codegen SDK that could be adapted for our codebase analysis system.

## 1. SDK Structure

Based on the import statements in the analysis.py file, the codegen SDK has the following structure:

```
codegen.sdk
├── core
│   ├── codebase.py
│   ├── class_definition.py
│   ├── file.py
│   ├── function.py
│   ├── symbol.py
│   ├── import_resolution.py
│   └── statements
│       ├── for_loop_statement.py
│       ├── if_block_statement.py
│       ├── try_catch_statement.py
│       └── while_statement.py
│   └── expressions
│       ├── binary_expression.py
│       ├── unary_expression.py
│       └── comparison_expression.py
└── enums.py
```

## 2. Core Classes

The codegen SDK provides several core classes for codebase analysis:

### 2.1 Codebase

The `Codebase` class represents a complete codebase, providing access to all files, functions, classes, and symbols.

```python
from codegen.sdk.core.codebase import Codebase

# Load codebase
codebase = Codebase.from_repo("owner/repository")

# Access codebase components
files = codebase.files
functions = codebase.functions
classes = codebase.classes
```

### 2.2 SourceFile

The `SourceFile` class represents a source code file, providing access to its content, functions, classes, and imports.

```python
from codegen.sdk.core.file import SourceFile

# Access file properties
file = codebase.files[0]
filepath = file.filepath
source = file.source
functions = file.functions
classes = file.classes
imports = file.imports
```

### 2.3 Function

The `Function` class represents a function or method, providing access to its name, parameters, code block, and complexity.

```python
from codegen.sdk.core.function import Function

# Access function properties
function = codebase.functions[0]
name = function.name
parameters = function.parameters
code_block = function.code_block
complexity = function.complexity
```

### 2.4 Class

The `Class` class represents a class definition, providing access to its name, methods, properties, and inheritance.

```python
from codegen.sdk.core.class_definition import Class

# Access class properties
class_def = codebase.classes[0]
name = class_def.name
methods = class_def.methods
properties = class_def.properties
base_classes = class_def.base_classes
```

### 2.5 Symbol

The `Symbol` class represents a symbol in the codebase, such as a variable, function, or class.

```python
from codegen.sdk.core.symbol import Symbol

# Access symbol properties
symbol = codebase.symbols[0]
name = symbol.name
symbol_type = symbol.symbol_type
references = symbol.references
```

### 2.6 Import

The `Import` class represents an import statement in a file.

```python
from codegen.sdk.core.import_resolution import Import

# Access import properties
import_stmt = file.imports[0]
module = import_stmt.module
name = import_stmt.name
```

## 3. Statement and Expression Classes

The codegen SDK provides classes for analyzing code statements and expressions:

### 3.1 Statements

- `ForLoopStatement`: Represents a for loop statement
- `IfBlockStatement`: Represents an if-else block statement
- `TryCatchStatement`: Represents a try-catch statement
- `WhileStatement`: Represents a while loop statement

### 3.2 Expressions

- `BinaryExpression`: Represents a binary expression (e.g., a + b)
- `UnaryExpression`: Represents a unary expression (e.g., !a)
- `ComparisonExpression`: Represents a comparison expression (e.g., a > b)

## 4. Enums

The codegen SDK provides enums for categorizing code elements:

- `EdgeType`: Types of edges in a code graph (e.g., CALLS, IMPORTS, INHERITS)
- `SymbolType`: Types of symbols in the codebase (e.g., FUNCTION, CLASS, VARIABLE)

## 5. Analysis Capabilities

Based on the import statements and the analysis.py file, the codegen SDK enables the following analysis capabilities:

### 5.1 Complexity Analysis

- Cyclomatic complexity calculation
- Halstead volume calculation
- Maintainability index calculation

### 5.2 Dependency Analysis

- Import dependency analysis
- Module dependency graph construction
- Circular dependency detection

### 5.3 Call Graph Analysis

- Function call graph construction
- Call chain analysis
- Entry point and leaf function detection

### 5.4 Code Quality Analysis

- Code duplication detection
- Naming consistency analysis
- Code smell detection

### 5.5 Architectural Analysis

- Pattern detection
- Coupling and cohesion analysis
- Modularity assessment

## 6. Potential Advanced Features
