# Comprehensive Codebase Analytics API Documentation

## Overview

This API provides comprehensive codebase analysis using graph-sitter for deep code understanding. It offers advanced features for analyzing code quality, detecting entry points, identifying critical files, and finding code issues with detailed context and fix suggestions.

## New Comprehensive Features

### üéØ Entry Point Detection
- **Main functions**: `main()`, `__main__`, `run()`, `start()`, `execute()`
- **CLI entry points**: Functions with CLI-related keywords
- **Web endpoints**: FastAPI, Flask, Express routes with decorators
- **Test functions**: Functions starting with `test_` or containing test keywords
- **Script entry points**: Files with `if __name__ == "__main__"`

### üîç Critical File Identification
- **Importance scoring**: 0-100 based on multiple factors
- **Dependency analysis**: Files with high incoming/outgoing dependencies
- **Symbol density**: Files defining many functions, classes, variables
- **Complexity analysis**: Files with high cyclomatic complexity
- **Size analysis**: Large files that may need attention

### üö® Comprehensive Issue Detection
- **Complexity Issues**: High cyclomatic complexity (>15), long functions (>50 lines)
- **Maintainability Issues**: God classes (>20 methods), deep inheritance (>5 levels)
- **Code Smells**: Too many parameters (>7), empty files
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: `eval()`, `exec()`, shell injection, hardcoded secrets
- **Performance Issues**: Inefficient patterns and anti-patterns

### üï∏Ô∏è Dependency Graph Analysis
- **Node types**: Files, functions, classes, modules
- **Centrality scoring**: Identifies most important nodes in the dependency graph
- **Connection analysis**: Most connected and influential components
- **Impact analysis**: Understanding how changes propagate through the codebase

## Integration Tips

### 1. CI/CD Integration
- Use `/analyze_issues` in pull request checks
- Set thresholds for critical and high-severity issues
- Block deployments with security vulnerabilities

### 2. Code Review Enhancement
- Use `/analyze_file` for detailed file reviews
- Check `/identify_critical_files` before major refactoring
- Use dependency graph for impact analysis

### 3. Technical Debt Management
- Regular `/comprehensive_analysis` for health monitoring
- Track maintainability index trends over time
- Prioritize fixes based on file importance scores

## Performance Considerations

- **Large repositories**: Use `max_issues` parameter to limit analysis scope
- **Incremental analysis**: Analyze specific files with `/analyze_file`
- **Caching**: Results are suitable for caching based on commit hash
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple endpoints can be called concurrently

## Error Handling

All endpoints return structured error responses:

```json
{
  "detail": "Analysis failed: Repository not found or access denied"
}
```

Common error scenarios:
- Repository access issues (404, 403)
- Analysis timeouts for very large repositories
- Graph-sitter parsing errors for unsupported languages
- Memory limits for extremely complex codebases

## Supported Languages

Currently optimized for:
- **Python** (full support)
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** (partial support)
- **Java** (basic support)
- **C/C++** (basic support)

Additional languages can be added by extending the graph-sitter language parsers.
